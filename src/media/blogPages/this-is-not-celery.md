Not Celery was my first released production. You can (probably) find it on your favorite streaming service.

We had more than a few recording sessions in his apartment, and it was a lot of fun to create a mobile studio. With the right equipment (and more importantly the right knowledge) it was more of a fun and challenging process than a difficult and frustrating journey.

# Be an engineer first, so you can make art later

Not Celery began its production lifecycle during the summer of '22, and by August I had a finished product.

But, it wasn't ready for release. The music just fell flat. And Cameron's wife knew it too... she was kind but not afraid to criticize what we had. Now the goal wasn't to break the charts - but I really had hoped to make something Cameron could be proud of.

I could have thought about the art... but that wouldn't have been productive or helpful. So instead, I sat down with another friend and I put on my engineering hat.

Anyone who wears the engineering hat for more a few minutes comes to this conclusion: there's a problem!

My friend helped me realize that the key was too low. This was killing the music because I was having Cameron sing at the low end of his vocal range. I just wasn't getting exciting vocal takes at that register. So I rebuilt our tracks around the key of Ab instead of F. Looking back, the aestetics of Ab were better anyway.

One recording session later (albeit a few mixing sessions as well)... we had an entirely different song.

My theory is this: that if you solve the _right_ problems upfront — you give yourself a better space to make better art.

And I'm starting to think that most of "being an engineer" is really just about defining the problem, not necessarily just solving it.
