Much grunge. Amateur vocals included in this one.

# Don't produce alone

It would have taken me more than a few more months to get behind a microphone if I was still producing by myself. 

This project wasn't supposed to have vocals on it; my original plan was to make another quick composition similar to the last two projects and focus on the mix in particular. 

I ended up impulsively writing some lyrics, and I asked my roommate to help me record some takes. Working together with someone else was wildly fun.

The hardest part was breaking through my awkwardness and letting go of my doubt as a singer. But, all that needed was 15 minutes of goofs and karaoke. We quickly found that [second-circle energy](https://youtu.be/Ub27yeXKUTY), and we spent a good bit of the afternoon experimenting and developing the chorus vocals.

It was a great experience, because my roommate was *completely* honest with me in the studio. I could genuinely ask him if he thought a take was good or bad. He wouldn't try to convince me a take wasn't as bad as it sounded, nor would he use a bad take as an opportunity to disrespect my ambition to sing. This was valuable for getting better takes, but the real value was in the space it created. We could laugh at the bad takes, and we could celebrate the (few) good takes.

Without this kind of help, I don't think I would have been able to put this project out, nor would I have had as much fun. There's a lot of content creators online that will teach you how to be a producer; though I'm sure it's been said, I haven't seen the "goof off and do this with your friends" video.

Invite your friends over to the studio. The creative forces of two are greater than the creative forces of one.
