# "Beauty So Ancient"

Gungor’s Late Have I Loved You is a modernization of one of St. Augustine’s confessions from circa 400 AD.

While I am not a Catholic, I think the confession vividly describes what it is like to experience a higher power. Whether or not you believe the world was created, it’s humbling to consider your place in such a massive universe - full of suffering, pain, and injustice, yes - but also full of an equally unmeasurable amount of delight and joy in the same breath.

“[You] banished my blindness…”

I’m continually becoming convicted that part of the human condition is wrapped up in our blindness to the beauty right in front of us. The wondrousness and frailty of life becomes a blur before our eyes, and as it evaporates a sense of spiritual dryness and general discontent remain in its place.

Perhaps to miss this beauty is the beginning of spiritual death.
