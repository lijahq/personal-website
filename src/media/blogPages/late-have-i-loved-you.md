# "Beauty So Ancient"

Gungor’s Late Have I Loved You is a modernization of one of St. Augustine’s confessions from circa 400 AD.


While I am not a Catholic, I think the confession vividly describes what it is like to experience a higher power. Whether or not you believe the world was created, it’s humbling to consider your place in such a massive universe - full of suffering, pain, and injustice, yes - but also full of an equally unmeasurable amount of delight and joy in the same breath.


“[You] banished my blindness…”


I’m continually becoming convicted that part of the human condition is wrapped up in our blindness to the beauty right in front of us. The wondrousness and frailty of life becomes a blur before our eyes, and as it evaporates a sense of spiritual dryness and general discontent remain in its place.


Perhaps to miss this beauty is the beginning of spiritual death.

## Production vs. Musicianship

This was my first time working with real drums - I was able to setup a drum kit in the basement of my church. I also found someone who was willing to let me borrow their drums mics and a preamp. 

When I first started recording music a few years back, I thought making music sound good was just a game of producing. That "good sounding" music comes from well-engineered sounds and from an understanding of how to mix them together eloquently.

It seems silly to me to think that way today. The flaws in my music I see today are not in the mix itself (though I absolutely wish I was more skilled, and intend to get better at mixing). Instead, I see the shift in tempo throughout my drumming, or I hear the intonation of my guitars. 

I've heard sound guys say "You can make anything sound good," and I do believe that it's true. That said, in search of an authentic sound, it seems to me that becoming a better producer could be counterproductive to becoming a better musician.

Maybe it's just convenience for now. It's easy to downplay my mixing, I'm still pretty new to it. What I hope is that as I get better tools to make music, I won't be distracted by the pursuit of "sounding good," whatever that means.

All this to say I think real drums sound way cooler.

## Album Cover!

My sister Lydia made this album cover, and I think it’s pretty awesome. I wish I was as cool as she was. Shoutout to the Lyd.
