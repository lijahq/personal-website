# Poetry!

I've been writing more poetry lately, and I wanted to record some music alongside a poem. 

I like the freedom and sandbox that spoken word is. This will not be the last poem/music upload. Didn't think of this too much at the time of recording - but after editing this I will definitely have my lines memorized next time.

While the guitar playing alongside my reading of the poem totally adds to the vibe - it was actually improvised to keep me from needing to read the poem in one take. I love how avoiding perfection (in the moment of recording the poem) ended up contributing a whole new layer to this project through the instrumental recordings.

Excited to be a year into finishing music projects, and even more excited for the year ahead.

# Choose Love

love is a choice

love is not a choice

i made three decisions this morning. 

i decided to get out of bed at 11, wear my flannel shirt, and eat my breakfast. i did not decide to wake up at 8:30, but today was a perfect day to enjoy the collapsing into sleep again. i have other shirts, but my laundry is dirty and i only wear like 4 shirts anyways. sometimes it’s a necessity to go without breakfast, but i love breakfast food and nothing beats a morning cup of coffee.

...

they say that love is a choice

and they also say that love is not a choice

on the day that i truly discover you, my lover

it could be said that i would choose to text you,

choose to go out with you,

choose to kiss you,

and possibly even go so far as to choose to marry you

...

love seems like a choice

and love doesn’t seem like a choice

who’s reading the terms and conditions of anything anyways?

you can’t really find love from a lawyer,

but we want our lovers to defend us and protect us

and we are disappointed when our lovers didn’t read our own terms and conditions before they fell in love with us.

...

love might be a choice,

and love might not be a choice

but love isn’t a choice yet!

i haven’t married you yet

i haven’t fell in love with you yet

maybe i haven’t even met you yet

...

love isn’t really a choice

and love isn’t really the absence of a choice either

soulmates is a beautiful term

for two lovers who were lucky to have crossed paths

who truly lived lived a rare phenomenon

known as happily ever after

but soulmates is a convenient term

for two lovers who sacrifice clarity,

tell each other lies,

and fight to be happy unhappy

...

love gave me a choice

but love is a multiple choice question with an obvious answer

perhaps love cannot be separated from sacrifice

but it’s strange how some lovers give up more than others

it’s quite confusing and disappointing to see how love gets mixed with self-preservation

and it’s sad to see aging lovers give themselves so begrudgingly to each other

what haunts me is the thought that this could become me

because no soul will ever protect me

no kiss will ever complete me,

and no lover will ever perfect me

...

love could be a choice

but love doesn’t have to be a choice!

it’s funny how few carefully made decisions can lead to great disaster

while most gut-level and benign calculations bring about many of life’s successes.

and yet we still calculate

we check our work, 

maybe we ask a friend to look over the numbers

though i’m not sure if you can really call a stranger on the internet your friend

...

maybe love is a choice
but it’s funny how you cannot choose peace

and maybe love is not a choice 
but the clock is ticking and time is a’ wasting

maybe love is choice
but you refuse to make a decision

and maybe love is not a choice
but it seems you’ve already made up your mind

maybe love is a choice 
but love may not choose you

and maybe love is not a choice
but love may very well still choose you

so, choose or do not choose!
perhaps they are the same in the end.

choose to love, and love without fear!
or do not choose to love, and love without fear!

because you must love!
you were put on this earth to do so!

true love does not come from fear,
it triumphs against it and pushes it away

if love is mostly what life has to give, 

then i am inclined to give back

too many of us are still in darkness,

and i can bet someone would appreciate the light that you so graciously share

...

poem and music are my own
