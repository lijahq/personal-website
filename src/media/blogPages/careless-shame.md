# "Go on and choose your fate"

The plan was not to release it as a single in the beginning. Careless Shame was just gonna be another minute-long composition with some basic mixing/mastering. Figured I'd release/post it by the end of April.

Things changed when roommate Jones encouraged me to build this one out. I hesitated at first, having only three weeks to complete it and final projects/tests approaching quickly, but I decided to go for it. We made quick work.

The deadlines were met - and with more than a little help from my friend Milli, Careless Shame has a video to go with the release.

## The Interlude

My favorite thing from this song is the middle section where Jones talks about his AirPods. I've wanted to have him record something like this on a track for awhile now - the Jones monologue can be a vibe.

We didn't have a plan for how to really execute. I just asked him to sit down with the SM58 and talk with me for about 15 minutes. What you hear on the track is unedited - I basically clipped out the 45 seconds he rambled about his AirPods and it fit perfectly into the music. I added an audience to clap him in and some effects on his voice to put him in a bigger space than my bedroom. I love the way it turned out, and I think it stitches many things about this project together.

## Thinking vs. Doing

Before this year, I spent a lot of time trying to learn more about mixing and producing. Looking back, much of this now feels like the "thinking" that jREG describes in this video.

I like that you could completely flip the ethos. What if the "doers" were thrown into jail instead of the "thinkers"? In my mind, the video doesn't condemn one or the other as much as it points out the necessity for one or the other depending on the context.

Goofs aside, I have really enjoyed spending time making things, rather than thinking about how I could actually make them. I've been able to do more than what I thought would be possible with what I'm dubbing (and sure has already been dubbed) as bedroom rock. Having put a few things out, I'm ready to take a step back and reevaluate. I'm ready to think about goals again. I have tons of questions about mixing and mastering; which, in and of itself isn't any different, but now they are questions about real experience I have compared to hypothetical scenarios.

So, it's time to chill out for a bit. 

Maybe I'll upload something this summer, maybe I won't. We shall see.
