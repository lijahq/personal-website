# The Interlude

My favorite thing from this song is the middle section where Jones talks about his AirPods. I've wanted to have him record something like this on a track for awhile now.

We didn't have a plan for how to really execute. I just asked him to sit down with the SM58 and talk with me for about 15 minutes. What you hear on the track is unedited - I basically clipped out the 45 seconds he rambled about his AirPods and it fit perfectly into the music. I added an audience to clap him in and some effects on his voice to put him in a bigger space than my bedroom. I love the way it turned out, and I think it stitches many things about this project together.
