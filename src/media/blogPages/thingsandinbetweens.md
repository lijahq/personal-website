# dissonant eyes

fearful eyes see the thorns in roses

and I can't help but see dissonance between your eyes

sometimes you pray in anxious haste

when it's just hell on earth

...

anxious souls see troubles in paradise

please tell me why your life's so dangerous

your circumstances always cursed, the way your burden weighs

when it's just hell on earth

...

just give me one more try to make this right

but I won't lie it's been turbulence in clouded skies

unending tries to change your mind

it's like its hell on earth

...

fearful eyes see the thorns in roses

and I can't help but see dissonance between your eyes

...

your anxious ways

they still contain a light inside

that burns so bright and I promise

one day this destiny will come alive

# change and lies

there he goes, whispering on and on

speaking silence to the ones he loves

it's a shame that no one stays

in his eyes they'd find a warm embrace

...

i promise i'll try to make my case

but you evoke fears that i can't explain

call it loyalty running through my veins

will you love me if i start to change?

...

there he goes, shouting on and on

preaching answers to the ones he loves

it's a wonder that so many stay

cause in his eyes they find a restless place

...

i promise i'll try to make my case

but you evoke fears that i can't explain

call it loyalty running through my veins

will you love me if i start to change?

# infinite skies

we were shooting stars reaching new horizons

finding freedom in weightlessness

graciously falling asleep in such a pretty sight

like snow falling on a dirty ground

you made me forget my flaws and doubts

but when the temperature drops

and when the ground stops keeping us from the truth

finding scars after wounds we couldn't help

...

we're falling, fading into gray

i've settled my tears and lost my fears

and even after all these years

it seems that some plans are meant to change

...

such a noble desire to find the ends of the universe,

it seems we've found the end

how could something so wondrous become so familiar?

how did an infinite become so small before my eyes?

like a dream that's fading

and it's memory is hanging by a thread

feeling gravity pull me back again

and i open my eyes while i'm falling through the skies

...

we're falling, fading into gray

i've settled my tears and lost my fears

and even after all these years

it seems that some plans are meant to change

...

in this mess we're lost together

and i still love you the same

in this mess we're lost together

and i will love you the same
