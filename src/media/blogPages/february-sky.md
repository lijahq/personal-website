So, when I built this website I figured I'd just self-host. Just use an old hunk-a-junk PC, install Linux, and run NGINX. 

And yeah, it wasn't too difficult to setup. I purchased a domain through Google domains, pointed it to my parent's home network (free rent included for my PC), and setup a DMZ on their router. I configured a firewall on the PC and ran some security tests online with the domain. As winter break came to a close, I felt good leaving the server behind at home.

It worked perfectly for a month. Then the Russians showed up.

My server got pinged with a laundry list of vulnerability attacks. Found out about it through the handful that my router outrightly rejected, because the router would send my dad a notification.

Nothing would have ever happened - but I had my dad pull the plug on it. I didn't want to lose sleep over it, knowing that if something was compromised outside of my PC on my parent's network I would be in deep dookie.

Anyways... so now the website is up in the cloud through Netlify. It's amazing how easy it was to configure compared to AWS. Maybe it all was a waste of time - I doubt I'll touch Nginx again in my career. At least not without ChatGPT...

I'm really happy with musical ideas from this project.

It's fun how quickly these little compositions come together for me, and it's tempting to expand them into fully full length songs. But I'm still keeping it short for now. My mixing skills just wouldn't do it justice. 

Eventually, I'll get there.

Small steps continue to seem to be the best steps in these endeavors.
