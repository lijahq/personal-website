            <p>
              Working at John Deere Financial as a part of team Customer Crew, I
              developed and deployed code for{" "}
              <a href="https://myfinancialaccounts.deere.com">
                My Financial Accounts
              </a>
              .
            </p>
            <p>
              My understanding of backend architecture grew quite a bit
              throughout this experience. Watching my team restructure their API
              for new integrations, I learned how to better think about
              designing API's. I also gained experience working with a variety
              of AWS technologies.

              I contributed to{" "}
              <a href="https://resultsfinder.unl.edu">resultsfinder.unl.edu</a>{" "}
              over the course of a semester, giving consulting to the
              stakeholders and providing new features to the website
            </p>
            <p>
              Specifically, I increased the search speeds dramatically by
              optimizing the system, and I implemented new features to integrate
              yield data into their database.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2024, I helped migrate their website to new infrastructure to
              keep up to date with university requirements.

              Helped out as a QA for intern projects and bug fixes. Lots of
              manual testing in particular. Became familiar with Jira. I also
              was given opporunities to learn more about web accessibility and
              UI/UX.
            </p>
            <p>
              Specifically, I spent time auditing their website templates
              according to WCAG 2.0 Level AA. Related to UI/UX â€” I presented
              research from analyzing Hotjar generated content from their
              website. It's interesting to compare the difference between how we
              expect users to engage with the website against how they actually
              used the website.
